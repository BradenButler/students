Hi, my name is Camille Williford! I'm a junior majoring in computer science and minoring in mathematics. I have been working as a co-op student at KUB as a application developer for a year now, so I'm just now getting back into the swing of school which I'm excited to make prgress on. My biggest hobbies outside of academic and professional pursuits are reading and rock climbing!
