My name is Ross Ketron, and I am a junior Computer Science major. I have a B.S. in Wildlife Biology, and I worked in that field for a while before returning to school for Computer Science. My interests range from web and software development to machine learning, data science, and computational biology. I'm excited for this class, and I look forward to learning more about the software development process.
