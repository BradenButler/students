Hi! I'm Harry Channing. I'm a math major and computer science minor. I'm excited to be in this class all of y'all this semester and I'm currently applying to business analytics graduate programs. In my free time, I sleep a lot, go to the gym, and cook. Hanging out with friends is also dank! Hope y'all have a wonderful semester!
