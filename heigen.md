I am Henry Eigen and I am a student at the EECS department. I've been programming for fun ever since I taught myself how to code in the 9th grade. The more I learn about how different software engineering as a job is from SWE for fun, the more interested I am in dropping out and becoming a carpenter or similar career which doesn't have version conflicts and Jira boards...


HW 2:

Github Fork: A fork creates a new copy of a repository, including all of its branches. The copy is independent of the repository is was copied from. Changes to the original repo will not affect the new repo and vice versa.

Git Clone: Make a local copy of a repository. The copy can be tied to the original repository, but until it is, it acts as an independent repo.

Git Branch: A kind of a "checkpoint". A branch has an independent history of edits and commits, and doesn't affect the other branches until they are merged.

While "branch off" and "fork off" are synonymous in everyday language, they mean different things in the context of git(hub). Forks are typically starting points for a new project which builds off an existing one. Branches are typically used as a way to make edits in the short term with the intention of merging the branches changes into the original repo.
