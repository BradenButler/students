My name is Taylor Rogers, and I am a sophomore majoring in computer science.
Although I don't have much experience with software engineering and github, 
I'm looking forward to learning more and working with others. One of my
interests include data analytics, most notably in baseball. I'm also interested
in how computer science connects with other disciplines, which is why I 
am pursuing a minor in information sciences.
